Freshdesk::Ticket.create(body)

# Dealing with errors
# -------------------

# When the response code isn't 2XX, or the response body indicates your authentication failed, you will get Freshdesk::Error object back and can inspect the response code and body.

# With bad authentication:
Freshdesk.configure { |c| c.api_key = 'wrong key' }
object = Freshdesk::Ticket.find(10) #=> #<Freshdesk::ResponseError: Freshdesk::ResponseError>
object.body # => "{\"require_login\":true}"
object.code # => 200

# When a record isn't found:
object = Freshdesk::Ticket.find(11230) #=> #<Freshdesk::ResponseError: Freshdesk::ResponseError>
object.body # => "{\"errors\":{\"error\":\"Record Not Found\"}}"
object.code # 404
